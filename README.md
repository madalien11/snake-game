#### Description: In this single-player game, the user controls a moving snake using WASD keys on the keyboard.
The objective is for the user to move the snake to eat fruits that appear randomly on the screen.
Two types of fruit:
Non flashing fruit: worth 10 points
Flashing fruit: gives snake a speed boost
If the snake touches itself, the game is over. 
As the snake eats more fruits, it becomes difficult to control as it grows longer and longer.
The goal is to get the highest score possible. The sessionâ€™s score and highest score is shown on the screen.
